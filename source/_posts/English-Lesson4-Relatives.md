Then, I will use these words to write a small essay.

In China, I only live with my immediate family which consists of my mom and dad in Wuhan. My cousin also lives in Wuhan, too. He is ten years older than me. My grandparents will invite many relatives to attend a family reunion at their house in the countryside of Hunan every spring festival. My uncles, aunts, nephews, and nieces all will attend this gathering. It's about 15 members or more of my extended family. We always watch the fireworks shows and have meals together. This is a wonderful memory of my life.
