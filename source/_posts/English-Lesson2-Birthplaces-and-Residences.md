**TL; DR**



Today, I will start to learn oral English and record what I have learned from the lessons. And the first lesson is Brithplaces and Residences. In this article, I will record the knowledge I am unfamiliar with and the words I pronounce or spell incorrectly.



<!--more-->



## Knowledge

+ Birthplace: a place where a person was born.

+ Residence: a place where a person lives.

+ Town: a place where a person lives or works, smaller than a city.

+ Countryside: the land which is away from towns and cities,  which has farms, fields, forests, etc.

+ Enroll: to register officially as a participant or member.



So I need to make sentences with those words:



My birthplace is Wuhan in China with lots of people and lakes. In addition, Wuhan has many subway lines. So It is very convenient for me to get anywhere. Right now, I live in Singapore and work as a software engineer in Shopee, which is an internet e-commerce company. I think my room is very comfortable because I have my own bathroom.

A town is smaller than a city. In my memory, I don't have any experience in a town. 

My grandparents live in the countryside. I always have meals with my extended family at my grandparents' house during the sprint festival.

At last, I enrolled at Shanxi university.
