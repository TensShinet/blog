## My Experience



### Friday, 7 October 2022



When I finished playing the LOL, it was about 11:00 pm, and I started to feel cold. At that moment, I might have a fever. As a result, I immediately went to sleep, hoping sleep could help me.



### Sartuday, 8 October 2022



I suddenly woke up at 3:00 am, and I felt very uncomfortable. But I was exhausted. I only continued to sleep. And in the morning, I woke up. It was excruciating. At that moment, I knew I had a fever. Therefore, I used a test Covid19 cassettes. And finally, I found I got Covid19.



Immediately, I told my roommates and asked them to stay away from me. After two oral English classes, I felt exhausted. I slept for a while and decided to go clinic in the afternoon.



But unfortunately, clinics near me were closed! So, I bought some food and a thermometer and could only go home. 



At home, I ate a tab of ibuprofen. And my temperature dropped. I chose to rest early.



### Sunday, 9 October 2022



This was my worst day. I had a fever of 39.8Â°C and a soar throat at 2:00 am. I barely survived until eight in the morning. I went to the clinic near my house. A female doctor checked me out, gave me some medicine and a medical certificate, and let me stay home for self-isolation.



At night, I felt my throat was so sore that I couldn't sleep.



### Monday, 10 October 2022



I had a fever and sore throat and took my medicine on time.



### Tuesday, 11 October 2022



I had a fever, sore throat, runny nose, and cough with sputum, and I took my medicine on time.



### Wednesday, 12 October 2022



I hardly had a fever, and my throat was getting better. I felt better. But I also had a cough with sputum. And I took my medicine on time.



### Thursday, 13 October 2022



I didn't have a fever, and my throat wasn't sore. I felt good! I can have a good sleep. But I also had a cough with sputum.





### Friday, 14 October 2022



I didn't have a fever, and my throat wasn't sore. I felt good! I can have a good sleep. But I also had a cough with sputum.



## At Last



Thanks to my roommate: Rui Qin. He brought food to me every day!
